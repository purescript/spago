## [Unreleased]

Other improvements:
- builds with Cabal successfully
- update to latest `versions` dependency: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/versions-6.0.1/changelog
- Fix output truncation with `--json-errors`, many warnings and build failure (#1199)
- Update README with info about depending on a freshly added library
- Fixed globbing issue where `/.spago` behaves differently than `.spago` in `.gitignore`
- Fixed empty output for `--verbose-stats` when there are no errors or warnings.
- Added support for `--package-set` options for `spago upgrade`.
- `spago repl` now writes a `.purs-repl` file, unless already there, containing `import Prelude`.
- Added typo suggestions upon failing to find a package by name.
- `spago publish` now checks that the publish location matches one of the remotes in the current Git repository.
- Emoji ✅ ❌ ‼️ replaced with ✓ ✘ ‼ respectively, and are not printed at all with `--no-color`.
- `spago bundle` now writes a special marker into the bundle and will refuse to
  overwrite the file if the marker isn't present, assuming that the file was
  manually created or edited, not generated by Spago itself.
- migrated tests to the `spec-node` runner.
- when multiple dependencies share a monorepo, that repo is cloned only once and
  cached locally.
- `spago publish` now allows to publish a package with some test (but only
  test!) dependencies not present in the registry.
- errors and warnings are now explicitly labeled as "ERROR" and "WARNING" in
  Spago build output.
- always using forward slash as path separator in lockfile, regardless of the
  platform, so that the lockfile doesn't keep changing when team members run
  Spago on different platforms.
- when encountering a mistyped option for a command, Spago will show help for
  that command, not root help.
- a new `spago init --subpackage foo` option to initialize a sub-project in the
  current workspace.
- #1110: `spago publish` will now install packages returned by the registry solver
  before trying to build with them.
- Spago no longer ignores config fields that it doesn't recognize. This should
  help catch typos in field names.
- When the `publish.location` field is missing, `spago publish` will attempt to
  figure out the location from Git remotes and write it back to `spago.yaml`.
- Internally Spago uses stricter-typed file paths.
- Spago can now be launched from a directory nested within the workspace, not
  just from workspace root.
- `spago install` warns the user when the installed versions of packages are outside
  their specified dependency ranges.
- `spago publish` no longer tries to validate all workspace dependencies, but
  only the (transitive) dependencies of the project being published.
- Restored broken type-directed search in generated docs.
- `spago graph modules` now correctly reports extra-packages located outside the
  workspace root.

- Fix caching on Windows CI (#728, #741)

## [0.19.0] - 2021-01-06

Breaking changes (😱!!!):
- **Deprecate `-d` flag for `deps-only` (#712)** - instead only support the `--deps-only` long form
- **Switch from `-D` to `-d` as shorthand for specifying dependencies within `spago repl` (#712)**

New features:
- Add `spago script` command. It can be used to run standalone PureScript files as scripts (#712, #724, #683)

Other improvements:
- `spago repl` will no longer create a (mostly unused) full project skeleton in a temporary directory when a config is not found (#712)
- `spago init` and `spago upgrade-set` will now pick the latest set for the available compiler, rathen than just the latest (#721, #687, #657, #666)

## [0.18.1] - 2020-12-22

Breaking changes (😱!!!):
- **Remove `login` command (#705)**

  It was introduced in preparation for a `publish` command that would require a GitHub token to be provided,
  but it is obsolete now, as the new Registry workflow will not require it.
  While it's technically a breaking change, it should be of very low impact since no one should be using this anyways.

- **Upgrade to Dhall 20.0.0 and GHC 8.6.5 (#695, #685)**

  The upgrade fixes several bugs related to the upstream dhall-haskell implementation, but introduces
  a breaking change in the parser, as reserved words are not accepted anymore in certain positions.
  While the upstream package sets have been patched to be compatible with the change, this is a breaking change
  for all the existing configurations that make use of Dhall reserved words (such as `assert`, `let`, etc).

New features:
- Add `exec-args` as alias to `node-args`, to clarify that the args are
  forwarded to whichever backend is being targeted (go, js, etc), not
  exclusively NodeJS (#710, #709)

Bugfixes:
- Don't create the global cache folder at all if the user specifies `--global-cache=skip` (#705, 704)
- Don't require a `spago.dhall` anymore when the `--no-build` flag is passed (#705, 634)

Other improvements:
- CI: switch from Travis to GitHub Actions (#695)

## [0.17.0] - 2020-10-29

Breaking changes (😱!!!):
- **Specify the package set version via `--tag` (#680)**

  Example usage: `spago init --tag psc-0.13.2-20190725` and `spago upgrade-set --tag psc-0.13.2-20190725`.
  This is a breaking change because we are removing support for the old spacchetti/spacchetti-style location (i.e. in the src/packages.dhall) for the upgrade-set command.

Bugfixes:
- Remove dependency on `libtinfo`, removing the biggest cause of friction for using the precompiled binary on various Linux distros (#684)
- Correctly parse flags to be passed to the compiler (#688)

## [0.16.0] - 2020-08-14

Breaking changes (😱!!!):
- **Remove shorthands for `color`, `before`, `then`, and `else` flags (#670, #664)**

  Both `then` and `target` had the shorthand `t`, so the shorthand for `then` was removed.
  Since `then`, `before`, and `else` are all shared between several commands, it seemed
  natural to remove the shorthands for the other shared commands too, so as to not cause
  future shorthand name conflicts.
  A similar collision problem happened with the `color` flag, so its shorthand was removed.
- **Pass main function argument to `--run` for alternate backends (#668)**

  This is a braking change because now alternate backends are expected to accept
  an argument to their `run` flag. This change was coordinated among various backends
  so the migration should be relatively smooth, but you should check if your backend
  it able to support this.

New features:
- Upgrade to `docs-search@v0.0.10`, that introduces grouping by package in local docs (#679)
- Ignore `.gitignore`d files in `--watch` by default - you can disable this with `--allow-ignored` (#665)
- Support `upgrade-set` for alternative package-set repositories (#671)

Bugfixes:
- Make the output of `spago --version` the same with `spago version` (#675)
- Ensure the existence of the global cache directory (#672, #667)

Other improvements:
- Docs: updated package addition/overriding syntax to use `with` syntax (#661, #663)
- Docs: fix Webpack template (#653)
- Docs: document how to pass arguments to `main` (#655)
- Error messages: do not print "Installation complete" if nothing was installed (#676)

## [0.15.3] - 2020-06-15

New features:
- Add `--version` flag to print the version (in addition to the `version` command) (#628)

Bugfixes:
- Actually run `else` commands when `spago run` fails (#632)
- Don't use absolute paths for executables in Windows (#639)

Other improvements:
- Docs: note that `build` also runs `install` (#624)
- Docs: document how to install all the packages in the set (#625)
- Docs: stop suggesting using Parcel and Spago at the same time (#626)

- CI: upgrade to `purs` v.13.8 (#642)
- CI: stop upgrading broken static binary on release (#620)


## [0.15.2] - 2020-04-15

Breaking changes (😱!!!):
- **Remove the deprecated `--no-share-output` flag (#610)**

  It has been disabled since some time now, so you can just remove it from your build commands.

New features:
- Add the `spago path global-cache` subcommand to output the location of the global cache (#613, #591)

Bugfixes:
- Fix encoding issues causing crashes when running in various locales (#595, #533, #507, #576)
- Respect TERM=dumb by disabling colors when set (#581, #579)
- Run package set commands without a project config being present (#393, #610)
- Fail as soon as possible when not finding a necessary executable (#578, #610)
- Don't exclude the `metadata` package from the set (#609, #610)
- Ensure `psci-support` is installed when starting the repl (#612, #550)
- Ensure dependencies are installed before starting the repl (#611, #610)

Other improvements:

- Deps: upgrade `dhall` to `1.31.1` (#600)
- Curator: move to its own repo (#586)

## [0.14.0] - 2020-02-09

Breaking changes (😱!!!):
- **Replace `list-packages` command with `ls packages` and `ls deps` (#563)**

  This is happening for future extensibility, i.e. so that we can add any
  `spago ls $whatever` subcommand in a non-breaking way whenever we'll want to
  list more things.

  How things got renamed:
  - `spago list-packages` → `spago ls packages`
  - `spago list-packages -f direct` → `spago ls deps`
  - `spago list-packages -f transitive` → `spago ls deps -t`

  Note: the `list-packages` command is still there to provide a semi-gracious transition path for folks, and will be removed in a future release.

New features:
- Allow `verify-set` to work with either a `spago.dhall` or a `packages.dhall` (#515)
- Create `.purs-repl` file when running `spago init` (#555, #558)
- Add `--source-maps` flag to build commands (#545, #562)
- Add `--quiet` and `--no-color` global flags to better control logging (#548)

Bugfixes:
- Fix a few watch-mode buffering and concurrency issues (#549)
- Fix watching relative paths in sources config (e.g. `../src/**/*.purs`) (#556)
- Make the `ensureConfig` function safe (#561, #531)
- Retry downloading packages on network errors (#557, #565)

Other improvements:
- Docs: fix misc typos in README (#566)
- Docs: fix typo in `packages.dhall` template (#539)
- Docs: remove mention of shared output folder in README (#559, #552)
- Docs: update links: spacchetti/spago → purescript/spago
- CI: update to `purs-0.13.6` (#542)
- CI: update CI to the new location of the repo (#560)
- Deps: update to `purescript-docs-search-0.0.8` (#543)
- Deps: update to `dhall-1.29` and `github-0.24` (#553)

## [0.13.1] - 2020-01-10

New features:
- Add `--before`, `--then` and `--else` flags to specify commands to run before and after a build (#532, #410)

Other improvements:
- Docs: fix npm command line argument in README (#597)

## [0.13.0] - 2019-12-19

Breaking changes (😱!!!):
- **Disable `output` folder sharing (#526)**

  This reverts an (accidentally) breaking changes introduced in `0.11.0`, for which
  Spago would take decisions on where the `output` folder should be in order to
  share some compilation results. This turned out to break some other things, so
  we'll stop trying to be smart about it here.

New features:
- Enable HTTP(S) proxies on the NPM installation (#460, #522)

Other improvements:
- Log backend build command when building (#521)
- Deps: update `purescript-docs-search` version to `0.0.6` (#525)
- CI: update `purs` version to `0.13.5` (#513)
- CI: fix Haddocks and start testing them in CI (#511, #516)
- Curator: automate updating `purs` version (#514)
- Curator: automate updating the `purescript-docs-search` version (#519)

## [0.12.1] - 2019-11-17

Bugfixes:
- Fix macOS release artifact (#503, #504)
- Complete parser implementation for module declarations, for `spago test` (#499)

Other improvements:
- Docs: fix typo in README (#498)
- Errors: use `logWarn` for all warnings (#501)

## [0.12.0] - 2019-11-15

Breaking changes (😱!!!):
- **Revert back to dynamically linked binary on Linux (#502, #500, #497)**

  The static binary was still dynamically linking to `glibc`, causing it to be broken on
  some distros. So for now we're back on a dynamically-linked executable.

## [0.11.1] - 2019-11-12

This is identical to `0.11.0`, but published under a new version number due to mishaps in the publishing CI process.

## [0.11.0] - 2019-11-12

Breaking changes (😱!!!):
- **Remove `psc-package`-related commands (#423, #425)**

  Since we are approaching a stable release and `spago` feature set is a superset of `psc-package` ones,
  from this release we do not support the commands to interop with `psc-package`:
  `psc-package-local-setup`, `psc-package-insdhall` and `psc-package-clean` commands.
- **Start sharing the output folder in monorepos, to reduce build duplication (#377, #422)**

  This is a breaking change because your build might stop working if you were relying
  on the `output` folder being in a certain place, and if you were passing `--output`
  as an option to `purs`.
  However, you can pass the `--no-share-output` flag to disable this behavior
- **Build static binaries for Linux (#437, 427)**

  This should fix the dynamic-library-compatibility problems on some distributions.
  It should work as well as the old dynamic binary, but it's theoretically a breaking change since
  some behaviours might be different.
- **Move all logging to `stderr` (#256, #475, #476, #486)**

  All "business output" (e.g. `spago sources`) will stay on `stdout`, so in practice everything
  should be fine, but this is theoretically a breaking change since someone might be depending
  on the output we had so far.


New features:
- add support for `spago build` and `spago run` with alternate backends (#355, #426, #452, #435)

  E.g: add the key `backend = "psgo"` in `spago.dhall` to compile/run with `psgo`
- add new command `spago path` that returns the paths used in the project.

  E.g. `spago path output` returns the output path so that it can be shared with tools such as `purs-loader`. (#463)
- `spago docs` now displays a link to the generated docs' `index.html`, and opens them in the browser when passed the `--open` flag (#379, #421)
- `spago init` has new `--no-comments` flag which skips adding tutorial comments to the generated `spago.dhall` and `packages.dhall` files (#417, #428)
- `spago verify-set` now compiles everything, to detect duplicate module names. This can be disabled with `--no-check-modules-unique` (#438)
- `spago install purescript-XYZ` will now strip `purescript-` prefix and install XYZ (if it exists in package set) instead of just failing with a warning (#367, #443)
- `spago run` now allows to pipe `stdin` to your running project (#488, #490)

Bugfixes:
- Fix Ctrl-C handling in REPL when using NPM installation on Windows (#493, #483)
- Fix confusing warning when trying to `spago install` a package already present in project dependencies list (#436, #439)
- Warn (but don't error) when trying to `--watch` missing directories (#406, #420, #447, #448)
- Do not watch files in `.spago` folder when running with `--watch` (#430, #446)
- The `--clear-screen` flag (usable e.g. with `spago build --watch`) now also resets cursor position, so the rebuild message always appears at top left of the screen (#465, #466)
- Allow additional fields in the config for local packages (#470)
- Fix `--config` option: get the correct paths when config file is in another directory (#478, #484)

Other improvements:
- Tests: speed up test suite by replacing some end-to-end tests with unit/property tests (#445, #440)
- Tests: update instructions to run tests (#449)
- Tests: always run test suites with UTF8 encoding (#482)
- Docs: various improvements to README (#432, #457, #464, #487)
- Docs: add "getting started" guides for Parcel, Webpack and Nodemon (#456, #461, #473)
- Errors: improve cache skipping error (#453, #480, #481)
- Errors: add a nice error message when trying to run `spago test` with no test modules (#489, #383, #492)
- Refactor: fix `hlint` warnings (#450)
- Refactor: rewrite Curator for moar maintainability (#458, #419)
- Deps: update to Dhall 1.27 and Purs 0.13.4 (#469)
- Deps: revert to GHC 8.4.4 and LTS-12 (#479)
- CI: fix release code (#494, #495)


## [0.10.0] - 2019-09-21

Breaking changes (😱!!!):
- **Flags and arguments that you want to give to `purs` are now passed with `--purs-args` (#353, #366)**

  The previous behaviour in which all arguments that could not parse as `spago` arguments
  were passed along to `purs` was sometimes confusing (e.g. when using `--path` and multiple
  arguments).

New features:
- Support watching js files (#407, #205)
- New `--no-search` flag for `spago docs` to skip patching the documentation using `purescript-docs-search` (#400)
- New `-x` flag for specifying the config path location (#357, #329)
- New `spago login` command, to save a GitHub token to the cache so it can be used for various operations hitting GitHub (#391, #403)

Bugfixes:
- "Quit" command in watch mode now actually quits (#390, #389)
- Do not compile files twice when using `--watch` and Vim (#346, #371)
- Use `git clone` instead of `git fetch` when fetching a package, so all tags can be installed (#373, #374)
- Fix Windows global cache location; now uses `LocalAppData` as default (#384, #380)
- Fix naming clash in short flag for repl dependencies (#352, #350)
- Fix failure to copy to global cache on a different filesystem (#385, #386)
- Fix watch function on Windows (issue with paths) (#387, #380, #401)
- Look up remote imports dynamically when doing frozen check, to always find the right `packages.dhall` (#349, #402)

Other Improvements:
- Performance: make no-op `spago install` faster (#409, #412)
- CI: remove reviews limitation on mergify (#354)
- CI: various fixes (#362, #368, #382, #388, #418)
- Docs: fix syntax errors in template comment (#369, #413, #408)
- Docs: fix link for package-set from commit (#405)
- Docs: keep README up to date with new features (#398, #347)
- Deps: upgrade to lts-14 and GHC-8.6 (#395)
- Deps: upgrade to dhall-1.26.0, v10 of the standard (#411, #358)

## [0.9.0] - 2019-07-30

Breaking changes (!!!):
- **Rename `package-set-upgrade` to `upgrade-set` (#336)**

  You now have to call `spago upgrade-set` if you wish to upgrade your package-sets version

- **Move the `--jobs` flag to be global (#338)**

  If you were invoking spago in this way: `spago install -j 10`, you now have to use `spago -j 10 install` instead

- **Import local packages `as Location` (#301, #244)**

  Before you'd import a local package in this way:

  ```dhall
  let additions =
    { foobar =
        mkPackage
          (../foobar/spago.dhall).dependencies
          "../foobar"
          "local-fix-whatever"
    }
  ```

  ..but now you'll have to import it using `as Location` instead:

## [0.6.0] - 2018-12-16

First release under the name "spago".

Main changes from the previous "spacchetti-cli" incarnation:
- Rename `spacchetti-cli` → `spago` (#23)
- Publish on NPM under the new name `purescript-spago` (#35)
- Add some commands from `psc-package`:
  - `init` (#12): initialize a new sample project with a `spago.dhall` and a `packages.dhall` config files
  - `install` (#11, #32): concurrently fetch dependencies declared in `spago.dhall` file
  - `sources` (#13): print source globs
  - `build`: compile the project with `purs`
- Migrate old commands from `spacchetti-cli` that are specific to local psc-package projects:
  - `local-setup` is now `psc-package-local-setup`
  - `insdhall` is now `psc-package-insdhall`
  - `clean` is now `psc-package-clean`
- Add some commands from `purp` (#26):
  - `test`: compile and run a module from the `test/` folder
  - `bundle`: bundle all sources in a single file
  - `make-module`: export the above bundle so it can be `require`d from js
- Stop depending on `dhall` and `dhall-to-json` commands and instead depend on `dhall` and `dhall-json` libraries
- Freeze `spacchetti` package-set import in `packages.dhall`, so `dhall` caching works for subsequent executions
- Move to v4.0.0 of `dhall`
- Add integration tests for most of the commands (#31, #30)

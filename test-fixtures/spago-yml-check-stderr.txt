Reading Spago workspace configuration...

✘ Couldn't parse Spago config, error:


  Did not find "spago.yaml". Spago's configuration files must end with `.yaml`, not `.yml`.
  Try renaming "spago.yml" to "spago.yaml" or run `spago init` to initialize a new project.


The configuration file help can be found here https://github.com/purescript/spago#the-configuration-file

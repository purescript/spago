Your package "aaa" is not ready for publishing yet, encountered 1 error:


✘ The tag (v0.0.1) does not match the expected tag (v0.0.2).
Fix all other publishing-related errors first before creating the correct tag. Do not push your created tag to its remote. Prematurely creating and pushing a tag can lead to unpublishable tags.
To create the tag, you can run:
  git tag v0.0.2

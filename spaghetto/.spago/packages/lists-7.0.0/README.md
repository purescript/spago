This library defines strict and lazy linked lists, and associated helper functions and type class instances.

_Note_: This module is an improvement over `Data.Array` when working with immutable lists of data in a purely-functional setting, but does not have good random-access performance.

## Installation

```
spago install lists
```

according to its terms, we have included GHC's license in the file

## Documentation

Module documentation is [published on Pursuit](http://pursuit.purescript.org/packages/purescript-lists).

# Purescript pipes

> Port of the haskell pipes library by Gabriel Gonzalez to purescript:
> https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pipes

## Thanks to

* @scott-christopher for porting `ListT` and writing the `MonadError`,
  `MonadWriter`, `MonadPlus` and `Alternative` instances for `Proxy`!

## How-To

For an in-depth overview of pipes follow the tutorial that comes with the
Haskell pipes library. The concepts apply one to one to purescript-pipes.

Also have a look at the examples that come with purescript-pipes. You can run
them using `npm run example`.

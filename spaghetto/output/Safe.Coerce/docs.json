This function behaves identically to\n`unsafeCoerce` at runtime.

For example, if you have an `Array (Conj a)` and you\nwant an `Array (Disj a)`, you could do `Data.Array.map (un Conj >>> Disj)`, but\nthis performs an unnecessary traversal of the array, with O(n) cost.\n`coerce` accomplishes the same with only O(1) cost:\n\n```purescript\nmapConjToDisj :: forall a.
